Build a player versus computer web application version of "Rock Paper Scissors Spock Lizard".

Here's an explanation of how the game works. http://www.samkass.com/theories/RPSSL.html

The general idea of the application is as follows.

A user visits the application and is able to choose between rock, paper, scissors, spock or lizard. The application randomly chooses the computers choice and the user is presented with the computers choice along with who won the battle.

The user should be able to view statistics on how many times the player has won, how many times the computer has won and how many times each has chosen which option (rock, paper, etc...).

 

## Requirements
* Store statistics in an sql database.
*  Feel free to go as simple as you want with the front end design.
*  Authentication is not a requirement.
